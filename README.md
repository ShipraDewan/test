# Guavus Reflex

Guavus
Reflex® consists of a hardened and highly secure Base Processing Platform (BPP) and Analytics Fabric (RAF) that help you transform the way you design big data applications. You can leverage the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based analytics already built into it to gain a competitive edge by putting all your data to work, uncovering new insights and making better quality and timely decisions.

## Reflex Base Processing Platform

Its unique distributed architecture enables you to analyze data the instant it is captured, drive faster action where it is needed, lower costs and increase growth. Its comprises a technology stack that is carefully chosen and integrated into a hardened platform to accommodate use cases that are drawn upon many years of pioneering big data experience.

Big data experts at Guavus have selected the highest performing open-source components, enhanced them for manageability, stability and performance and integrated them into one hardened platform for creating a big data pipeline based on streaming analytics. These components will enable application developers to build, test, and deploy applications seamlessly.

Guavus technology is based on real time and near real time streaming analytics in which processing is moved to the data edge so that resources and spending are focused on analytics rather than transporting and storing massive quantities of raw data. This approach also allows you fast access to processed results— data is continuously processed so that actionable insights for critical business decisions are quickly available.

Application developers can pick and choose any of these components based on their use cases. These components are installed when you install Reflex Platform and can be extended as per business’ requirements and as per the components’ open source policies.

## Reflex Analytics Fabric

Guavus’ mission is to bring	advanced analytics through application of data science that improves efficiency, increases revenue, and saves money for organizations. RAF provides Guavus’ advanced analytics functions and integration of all the technologies needed to implement advanced analytics applications.

Each analytics module has a specific function and solves business problems. The analytics modules engage with the platform through APIs, calling the necessary algorithms and pulling in the appropriate data to meet the specific needs of the application. It has a modular architecture and registered analytics modules can be combined by an application developer to create an analytics pipeline.

## Self-service Analytics

* Enables big data applications development by Developers without Big Data expertise.
* Unlocks the value of your data; add new applications quickly and easily.
* Use GUI, Java, CLI or REST APIs to build pipelines.
* Applications built on RAF are agnostic to the underlying BPP. Simplifies deployment of applications into existing customer big data environments.
* Leverages existing clusters, data, and analytics.

## Accelerators and MicroApps

You can rapidly build additional Big Data analytics applications using the in-built Accelerators and MicroApps. These accelerators or MicroApps can be used as plugins and invoked through APIs when creating data pipelines.

## Deploying Reflex

The Guavus Reflex distributed architecture is the most flexible available today and can be deployed in a distributed or centralized model. Rather than transporting all the data back to a central site to be processed there, Guavus’ platform is based on a distributed architecture for optimal handling of data from separate silos. Regional sites can have smaller implementations of Reflex running at each site, performing the same advanced analytics at edge, in real-time.

By collecting data and analysing it at the edge, the amount of time needed to trigger closed loop actions or act upon the insights provided is significantly reduced and workflow inefficiencies downstream are removed.  The contextualized data can be then sent back to a central site in regular intervals, aggregating the regional findings and drawing further conclusions, including information from all sites and triggering further automated actions if desired. Data can be stored in the Guavus platform itself or fed to a central data lake. Reflex can also be deployed on the Public Cloud, Microsoft Azure.

Guavus provides a flexible DevOps environment to enable and empower application developers to develop and deploy applications. Guavus also provides operations, administration, and management of the clusters and containers in the same ecosystem. For example, application developers can use Apache Ambari to manage Hadoop clusters or use Ansible to automate provisioning and deployment.
